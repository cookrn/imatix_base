I've long been inspired by Pieter Hintjens and his work and am finally
creating an artifact of that admiration. There's a lot to be learned as
the tools focus on:

* State machines
* Code generation
* Meta code generators
* Build tooling
* Protocols
* Servers
* More...

To start, we'll dive into two different repositories: [GSL](https://github.com/imatix/gsl)
and [OpenAMQ](https://github.com/imatix/openamq). As both are archived, they have been
forked to repositories under [cookrn](https://cookrn.github.io/) as well:
[GSL](https://github.com/cookrn/gsl) and [OpenAMQ](https://github.com/cookrn/openamq/).

We're interested in getting these tools compile such that they're usable and render
their help messages and such (assuming their command line tools). Let's begin by
`make`-ing some things and see if they build! Inside of OpenAMQ, in the directory
named `tooling/base2`, when I run `make`, I see the following:

```
cookrn@hyperion:~/workspace/hintjens/openamq/tooling/base2$ make
cd xnf; if test -f Makefile; then make ; fi
cd icl; if test -f Makefile; then make ; fi
make[1]: Entering directory '/home/cookrn/workspace/hintjens/openamq/tooling/base2/icl'
c -q icl_mutex.c
make[1]: c: Command not found
Makefile:55: recipe for target 'icl_mutex.o' failed
make[1]: *** [icl_mutex.o] Error 127
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/cookrn/workspace/hintjens/openamq/tooling/base2/icl'
Makefile:38: recipe for target 'all' failed
make: *** [all] Error 2
```

The most relevant line I notice is `make[1]: c: Command not found`. So, where do we
get `c`?

```
cookrn@hyperion:~/workspace/hintjens$ find . -name "c"
./gsl/pcre/c
./gsl/src/c
./openamq/tooling/foreign/c
./openamq/tooling/foreign/c/c
```

Looks like we have a few options... Before we move forward though, let's talk about
why I started in `openamq/tooling/base2`. One of my primary interests is around XNF
, or XML Normal Form, which is a meta code generator or a generator which generates
generators. XNF was a tool fitting what Hintjens and iMatix called Model Oriented
Programming and you can find articles [here](https://imatix-legacy.github.io/mop/index.html)
about how this style was thought about. Sadly, the MOP articles are incomplete and,
as far as I can tell, XNF source is only published in base2 inside of OpenAMQ.

That's good enough for today :D
