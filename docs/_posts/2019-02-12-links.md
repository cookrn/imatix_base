As mentioned in the [previous post]({% post_url 2019-02-11-welcome %}), the
concept of [Model Oriented Programming](https://imatix-legacy.github.io/mop/index.html)
was important to how Pieter and iMatix thought about software architecture,
design, and development. Although they didn't finish the series on MOP, they
did write two articles:

* [Introduction](https://imatix-legacy.github.io/mop/introduction.html)
* [Beginning](https://imatix-legacy.github.io/mop/beginning.html)

For the same reason the OpenAMQ and GSL repositories were forked, the
[imatix-legacy/mop](https://github.com/imatix-legacy/mop) repository was forked
to [cookrn/mop](https://github.com/cookrn/mop) as well.

Parts of the following posts from Hintjen's blog are also related to the
MOP concept:

* [Generating Servers with zproto](http://hintjens.com/blog:75)
* [Solving the Makefile Problem](http://hintjens.com/blog:79)

Enjoy :D
