In the [first post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-02-11-welcome %}), we left off being stuck
missing the `c` program and having a few clues where to look for it...

```
cookrn@hyperion:~/workspace/hintjens$ find . -name "c"
./gsl/pcre/c
./gsl/src/c
./openamq/tooling/foreign/c
./openamq/tooling/foreign/c/c
```

Let's try adding each of these directories to our $PATH and comparing results.
First, the `gsl/pcre` directory:

```
cookrn@hyperion:~/workspace/hintjens/openamq/tooling/base2$ make -e PATH="/home/cookrn/workspace/hintjens/gsl/pcre:$PATH"
cd xnf; if test -f Makefile; then make ; fi
cd icl; if test -f Makefile; then make ; fi
make[1]: Entering directory '/home/cookrn/workspace/hintjens/openamq/tooling/base2/icl'
c -q icl_mutex.c
gcc: fatal error: no input files
compilation terminated.
Makefile:55: recipe for target 'icl_mutex.o' failed
make[1]: *** [icl_mutex.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/cookrn/workspace/hintjens/openamq/tooling/base2/icl'
Makefile:38: recipe for target 'all' failed
make: *** [all] Error 2
```

Second, the `gsl/src` directory:

```
cookrn@hyperion:~/workspace/hintjens/openamq/tooling/base2$ make -e PATH="/home/cookrn/workspace/hintjens/gsl/src:$PATH"
cd xnf; if test -f Makefile; then make ; fi
cd icl; if test -f Makefile; then make ; fi
make[1]: Entering directory '/home/cookrn/workspace/hintjens/openamq/tooling/base2/icl'
c -q icl_mutex.c
In file included from icl_mutex.c:39:0:
icl.h:704:10: fatal error: base_apr.h: No such file or directory
 #include "base_apr.h"
          ^~~~~~~~~~~~
compilation terminated.
Makefile:55: recipe for target 'icl_mutex.o' failed
make[1]: *** [icl_mutex.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/cookrn/workspace/hintjens/openamq/tooling/base2/icl'
Makefile:38: recipe for target 'all' failed
make: *** [all] Error 2
```

Last, the `openamq/tooling/foreign/c` directory:

```
cookrn@hyperion:~/workspace/hintjens/openamq/tooling/base2$ make -e PATH="/home/cookrn/workspace/hintjens/openamq/tooling/foreign/c:$PATH"
cd xnf; if test -f Makefile; then make ; fi
cd icl; if test -f Makefile; then make ; fi
make[1]: Entering directory '/home/cookrn/workspace/hintjens/openamq/tooling/base2/icl'
c -q icl_mutex.c
make[1]: execvp: c: Permission denied
Makefile:55: recipe for target 'icl_mutex.o' failed
make[1]: *** [icl_mutex.o] Error 127
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/cookrn/workspace/hintjens/openamq/tooling/base2/icl'
Makefile:38: recipe for target 'all' failed
make: *** [all] Error 2
```

Given the three errors, I'm suspicious of the first and last for no particular
reason other than they seem less relevant than the second one. Let's copy that
specific version of `c` into this repository and start using it in our $PATH.
We know we'll receive the same error though, so let's search for `base_apr.h`...

```
cookrn@hyperion:~/workspace/hintjens$ find . -name "base_apr.h"
./openamq/tooling/foreign/apr/base_apr.h
```

Since we have only one option, we'll look next time at how to include it in
our compilation options.
