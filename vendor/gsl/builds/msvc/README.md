These builds do not use the `pcre` sources contained within the GSL repository. Instead they rely on the [NuGet PCRE](https://www.nuget.org/packages/pcre) and [NuGet PCRE.redist](https://www.nuget.org/packages/pcre.redist) packages. This package currently supports only **Visual Studio 2012** and **Visual Studio 2010**. As a consequence there is currently no GSL build provided for **Visual Studio 2013**.
