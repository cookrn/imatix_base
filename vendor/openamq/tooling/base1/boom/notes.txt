Supporting the configure/make worldview

Option 1:
    configure -> creates make shell, make.bat
    make -> runs boomake build, boomake install, boomake clean

Option 2:
    configure -> renames makefile.xxx to Makefile
    make -> proper Makefile with targets

Option 3 (alternate):
    Windows:
        - generate dsw product workspace
        - dsp per project
        - make.bat invokes msdev

Product makefiles
    Unix:   product-level makefile
            calls individual makefiles per project
            configure renames makefiles
                - depending on cvs/non-cvs
                

    


- need some way to conditionally include/exclude components
    - e.g. gsl with/wo mysql
    <if> in pdl
    #define in source code

- replace mkdep with GSL code to scan sources
- can 'make' automatically install into TIT?
