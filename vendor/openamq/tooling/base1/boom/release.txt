2.4d18 - 2005/12/13

 - Removed -Wconversion for gcc, it produces more noise than signal

2.4d17 - 2005/11/28

 - added distrev option for standard and scripted workflows

2.4d11 - 2005/10/12

 - Changed processing of subdirectories within project, to do these after
   files in main directory rather than before.  This makes more sense in
   cases where there are dependencies between the two.

2.4d10 - 2005/10/06

 - distrev option at product level builds package using SVN revision number.

2.4d9 - 2005/10/03

 - Installs into IBASE/bin etc. even if files are in subdirectories.  To create
   mapped tree, use deploy option.

2.4d8 - 2005/09/16

 - Boom now defines SVN_REVISION macro at compile time.  This is the latest
   svn revision checked out, or the svn revision from which the sources were
   built, whichever is more recent.
 - The BUILDDATE macro in version.h has been deprecated to create more 
   stable sources (i.e. which don't change each time 'boom configure' is
   used).

 - Some commands were not echoed in verbose mode - fixed to echo all.
 - Minor fix to pwl_unix to report exact command if failed

 - Added CCOPTS macro for programs to report compiler syntax.
 - c scripts now support CFLAGS variable for Unix compatability

2.4d0 - 2005/08/25

 - Removed need to set INCDIR/LIBDIR in environment, and c script
   now complains if these are set and conflict with IBASE.

2.4c15 - 2005/08/19

 - Disabled tagging in 'version' until SVN is formalised

2.4c14 - 2005/08/19

 - Changed version.h generation to allow version.h to be included
   in many places in project.  If you want to embed the constants
   into your code, define VERSION_EMBED before including version.h.

2.4c13 - 2005/08/03

 - Fixed path generation for Unix boomake scripts.
 - boom -v|-s command now enables/disables tracing immediately
 - added -s|--silent to disable tracing

 - fixed some win32 scripting errors

2.4b6 - 2005/03/22
 - IBASE consistency check failed on win32
 - configure at product level showed too many messages (Linux)

2.4b5 - 2005/03/22

Pieter

    build process)
  - added 'boom version' command, prints the project acronym-version

2.4b - 2005/03/17
Pieter

  - improved output of boom (added --quiet option to boom and configure).
  - C compilations gave errors on Win32 - fixed.
  - boom no longer generates build.bat & build.sh for product source kits
    since these have been made redundant by configure/make.
  - makefiles were incorrectly generated at product level - fixed.
  - product source kit did not include makefiles/configure - fixed.
  - if no IBASE has been configured, configure issues a warning.
  - dots are no longer replaced by '_' in the archive name.  So we now
    get archives like "rbase_1.2_src.zip".

2.4a1 - 2005/03/17
Pieter

  - fixed various syntax errors and warnings in the generated boomake
    files.
  - changed "boom clean" to not delete the boomconf configuration file.
  - defines C preprocessor macro BOOM_MODEL that replaces the hard-coded
    version BUILDMODEL macros.  BOOM_MODEL is derived from the current
    setting in boomconf so can be changed by reconfiguration.
  - did not generate correct configure files at the product level - fixed.
  - makefiles now use correct BOOM_MODEL setting (done by making c/c.bat
    use the boomconf file - boomake no longer passes debug switch to c).
  - all user messages from boom, boom.gsl, boomake and configure now start
    with 'boom I:', 'boom W:', 'boom E:' as appropriate.
  - stamp_generate now produced/cleaned by boomake (not makefiles) and
    included with project source packages.
  - 'boom distrib' now regenerates project sources (scripted, standard
    workflows).

2.4a0 - 2005/03/16
Pieter

  - the install base (IBASE) can now be set at configure time using the
    --with-ibase option.  If this is not specified the value is taken from
    the environment variable IBASE and if that is not specified, it takes a
    system-dependent default.
  - the BOOM_MODEL environment variable, if defined, provides a default
    value for the boom build model.  Can be 'debug' or 'release'.
  - BUILDMODEL environment variable in boomake scripts has been removed in
    favour of BOOM_MODEL.  (base2/foreign patched OK).
  - the default build model has been changed to 'release' (was 'debug') for
    compatibility with the configure command.
  - the configure command now accepts a small range of options such as
    --help, -h, --version, -V.
  - 'configure --enable-debug' now configures the project for a debug
    build. Alternatively, 'boom --enable-debug configure'.
  - configure scripts and makefiles are now packaged with the product
    source and binary packages.
  - Unix boomake now builds Win32 zip files, with correct line endings
    (using the zip -l option).  Win32 boomake does not build tar.gz files
    because we don't assume tar is available.
  - at both product and project level, source kits now follow the Linux
    convention of containing a root directory named after the project and
    version.
  - "boom clean" removes source packages, when used in a CVS environment.
    (Not when building from a source package, which would be silly.)
  - "boom" without arguments now shows a page of help.  To reconfigure,
    you must run "boom configure".
  - added -h, --help, -V, --version options to the boom command.
  - added --enable-debug, --disable-debug, and --with-ibase options to the
    "boom configure" command.
  - improved output of "boom help" command (shows all allowed commands for
    project).
  - improved reaction of boomake to invalid commands (shows same output as
    "boom help").
  - at configure time, IBASE must be provided either via the environment,
    or via the --with-ibase option.
  - 'configure' no longer calls boom if it can't find its input makefiles;
    it now shows a message and exits.

2.3c1 - 2005/03/13
 Mato
    - fixed to c.bat to use correct libraries depending on
      win32 build model
    - fixes to c.bat to make builds with Visual Studio 7.1 work
    - added convert71.js script for converting DSP projects to
      Visual Studio 7.1 format
    - 'generated module' should derive 'generated header'

2.3c0 - 2005/02/25
 Pieter
    - use setlocal to create local environments when necessary
    - remove _install tree in product-level clean
    - handle errors passed from project to product builds
    - use better MSVC debug compile/links

2.3b2 - 2005/02/16
 Pieter
    - did not handle local INCDIR/LIBDIR when building in subdirectories
    - added 'degen' step for cleaning generated sources

2.3b1 - 2005/01/26
 Pieter
    - changed default root on Windows to c:\home (from c:\imatix)

2.3b0 - 2004/12/27

 Pieter
   - product building now resolves both principle IBASE directories
     and local _install directories (which get preference).
   - added 'temporary' class
