#   Since Boom relies on itself, you can't build it without
#   some bootstrapping.  You can do this from the command line
#   like this:
#   
#       gsl -xn1:pdl -doc:text -parse:1 buildxn1
#       gsl -xn1:pwl -doc:text -parse:1 buildxn1
#       gsl -pdl:boom boom
#
#   or, more simply, run this script:
#
#       gsl parsers.gsl
#       gsl -pdl:boom boom

include "mod_xn1.gsl"
xn1_load    ("pdl.xn1")
xn1_produce ("pdlparse.gsl", "parse", 1, 1)
delete root-> xn1
xn1_load    ("pwl.xn1")
xn1_produce ("pwlparse.gsl", "parse", 1, 1)
