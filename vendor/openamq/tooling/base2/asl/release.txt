- Improved error handling on closed sessions / connections.
- When peer detects client, no longer does full close hand-shake
  but sends close, then waits a second for connection to settle,
  then closes the connection.  This model is designed to allow
  the sending peer to receive the close method without making the
  recipient dependent on a close-ok, which will not arrive at
  once if the sender is pushing asynch methods.
