Changes in GSL/4
----------------

1. References to a->b are only converted to linear value when this is
implicit in the script.  Eg
    $(a->b) is unchanged
    x=a->b  is changed.

Extensions in GSL/4
-------------------

1. Pointers
2. a->b(cond,alias)
3.  .for/.else/.endfor

Still to do
-----------
1. Rationalise inbuilt functions
2.  a->b(cond,alias,count)
3. .function (xxx)
4. Better error messages for attribute fail.  !!!
5. while cond as name
6. commands as expressions
7. Careful where expressions are scalarised
8. Array objects
9. Debug functions: where (attr), scope dump, save to screen.
10. everything is an expression - what about =/==/:=
11. Disallow functions with reserved word as name
12. Exceptions
13. 'my' scope for main program.
