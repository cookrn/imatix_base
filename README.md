# iMatix Base

A collection of source code and examples from Pieter Hintjens and iMatix Corporation
used to build their products such as OpenAMQ and ZeroMQ. The primary motivation is
archeological and a suspicion that there's a lot to be learned.

See [the blog](https://cookrn.github.io/imatix_base) for more information.

## Requirements

* Docker
* Docker Compose
* Make

## Usage

For now, run `make` to build the container up to the latest blog post and use
`make shell` to run `bash` inside of the container.

Eventually, the built container will be treated as an executable to run the
compiled Base tooling.

## Notes

These are currently a scratch pad on the different tools included in the various
iMatix repositories.
